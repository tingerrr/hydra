= Introduction
`hydra` is a package primarily for displaying the active section or chapter in the header of your
document.

== Terminology & Semantics
#[
  The following terms are often used in the following sections to explain the behavior and reasoning
  of `hydra`:

  #show terms: its => grid(
    row-gutter: 1em,
    column-gutter: 0.4em,
    columns: (auto, auto),
    ..its.children.map(it => (
      align(right)[*#it.term*],
      align(left, par(justify: true, it.description)),
    )).flatten(),
  )

  / primary: The element which is primarily looked for and meant to be displayed.
  / ancestor: An element which is the immediate or transitive ancestor to the primary element.
    A level 3 heading is ancestor to both level 2 (directly) and level 1 headings (transitively).
  / scope: The scope of a primary element refers to the section of a document which is between the
    closest ancestors.
  / active: The active element refers to whatever element is considered for display. While this is
    usually the previous primary element, it may sometimes be the next primary element.
  / leading page: A leading page in a book is that, which is further along the content of the two
    visible pages at any time, this is the `end` alignement with respect to the document readin
    direction.
  / trailing page: A trailing page is that, which is not the leading page in a book.
]

The search for a primary element is always bounded to it's scope, such that, for the following
simplified document, the output of `hydra` does not revert to Section 1.1.

```typst
= Chapter 1
== Section 1.1

= Chapter 2
=== Subsection 2.1.1
#hydra(2)
```

For this the ancestors of an element must be known. For headings this is simple: \
#align(center, (
  `none`,
  `level: 1`,
  `level: 2`,
  `level: 3`,
  `...`,
).join([ #sym.arrow ]))

If `hydra` is used to query for level 2 headings it will only do so within the bounds of the closest
level 1-3 headings. In principle, elements other than headings can be used (see @custom), as long as
their semantic relationships are established.

= Features
== Sane Defaults
If `hydra` is called with no arguments it will not assume anything about your document other than
the typst defaults. If any of these defaults are changed they must be set for hydra too:
- paper size: `a4`
  - affects page size if not explicitly set
- page size: computed from paper size
  - affects top-margin if not set explicitly
- top margin: computed from page size
  - affects starting page check (see @starting-page)
- binding: `left`
  - the binding direction of the document as a book
  - affects book mode (see @book-mode)
- dir: `ltr`
  - denotes the reading direction of the pages (i.e. in which direction the document is read as a
    book)
  - affects book mode (see @book-mode)

== Custom Elements <custom>
Because some documents may use custom elements of some kind to display chapters or section like
elements, `hydra` allows defining its own selectors for tight control over how elements are
semantically related.

Given a custom element like so:
```typst
#let chapter = figure.with(kind: "chapter", supplement: [Chapter])
// ... show rules and additional setup

#chapter[Introduction]
#chapter[Main]
= Section 1.1
== Subsection 1.1.1
= Section 1.2
#chapter[Annex]
```

A user my want to query for the current chapter and section respectively:
```typst
#import "@preview/hydra:{{VERSION}}": hydra, selectors
#import selectors: custom

#let chap = figure.where(kind: "chapter")
#let sect = custom(heading.where(level: 1), ancestor: chap)

#set page(header: context if calc.odd(here().page()) {
  align(left, hydra(chap))
} else {
  align(right, hydra(sect))
})
```

The usage of `custom` allows specifying an element's ancestors, to ensure the scope is corectly
defined.

#pagebreak()
== Redundancy Checks
Generally `hydra` is used for heading like elements, i.e. elements which semantically describe a
section of a document. Whenever `hydra` is used in a place where its output would be redundant, it
will not show any output by default. The following sections explain the those checks more closely
and will generally assume that hydra is looking for headings.

=== Starting Page <starting-page>
Given a page which starts with a primary element, it will not show anything. If `skip-starting` is
set to `false`, it will fallback to the next element, in this case the heaiding at the top of the
page.

#let skip = load-examples("skip")
#figure(
  grid(columns: 2, show-examples(skip.a, width: 95%), show-examples(skip.b, width: 95%)),
  caption: [
    An example document showing `skip-starting: true` (left) and `skip-starting: false` (right).
  ],
)

For more complex selectors this will not correctly work if the first element on this page is an
ancestor. See #issue(8).

#pagebreak()
=== Book Mode <book-mode>
Given a leading page, if `book` is set to `true`, then if the previous primary element is still
visible on the previous (trailing) page it is also skipped.

#let book = load-examples("book")
#figure(
  grid(columns: 2, show-examples(book.a, width: 95%), show-examples(book.b, width: 95%)),
  caption: [An example document showing `book: false` (left) and `book: true` (right).],
)

This may produce unexpected results with `hydra` is used outside the header and the text direction
where it is used is different to where it's anchor (see @anchor) is placed.

#pagebreak()
== Optional Function Coloring
Hydra requires a context to work, more specifically it needs to know it's own location relative
to the elements it queries for. To avoid the need for a user having to use hydra inside context
expression all the time, `hydra` will do it by itself. But if it always did this, it would not allow
the user to actually check the return value. The following will not work:

```typst
#import "@preview/hydra:{{VERSION}}": hydra
#set page(header: {
  let chap = hydra(1)
  if chap != none [
    Chapter #chap
  ]
})
```

Because `hydra` needs a location it'll internally construct a context expression. The fix is quite
simple, if a location is provided the return is not opqaue and the callback result is returned as
is.

```typst
#import "@preview/hydra:{{VERSION}}": hydra
#set page(header: context {
  let chap = hydra(1, loc: here())
  if chap != none [
    Chapter #chap
  ]
})
```

This means that passing a location in contexts where one is already available will generally avoid
uncessary function coloring. This allows for more complex queries in casese where both a chapter
and section are shown for example.

== Anchoring <anchor>
To use `hydra` outside of the header, an `anchor` must be placed to get the correct active elements.
`hydra` will always use the last anchor it finds to search, it doesn't have ot be inside the header,
but should generally be, otherwise the behavior may be unexpected.

```typst
#import "@preview/hydra:{{VERSION}}": hydra, anchor
#set page(header: anchor(), footer: hydra())
```

= Reference
#let stable(is) = if is {
  show raw: it => bbox(fill: green.lighten(50%), it.text)
  `stable`
} else {
  show raw: it => bbox(fill: yellow.lighten(50%), it.text)
  `unstable`
}

== Stability
The following stability guarantees are made, this package tries to adhere to semantic versioning.

#table(stroke: none, columns: 2, gutter: 0.25em,
  stable(false), [API may change with any version bump.],
  stable(true), [
    API will not change without a major version bump or a minor version bump pre `1.0.0`, if such a
    change occures it is a bug and unintended.
  ],
)

== Custom Types
#set heading(outlined: false)
The following custom types are used to pass around information easily:

=== `sanitized-selector` #stable(true)
Defines a selector for an ancestor or primary element.
```typc
(
  target: queryable,
  filter: ((context, candidates) => bool) | none,
)
```

=== `hydra-selector` #stable(true)
Defines a pair of primary and ancestor element selectors.

```typc
(
  primary: sanitized-selector,
  ancestors: sanitized-selector | none,
)
```

=== `candidates` #stable(true)
Defines the candidates that have been found in a specific context.

```typc
(
  primary: (prev: content | none, next: content | none)
  ancestor: (prev: content | none, next: content | none)
)
```

=== `context` #stable(false)
Defines the options passed to hydra nad resolved contextual information needed for querying and
displaying.

```typc
(
  prev-filter: (context, candidates) => bool,
  next-filter: (context, candidates) => bool,
  display: (context, content) => content,
  skip-starting: bool,
  book: bool,
  top-margin: length,
  anchor: label | none,
  loc: location,
  primary: sanitized-selector,
  ancestors: sanitized-selector,
)
```
